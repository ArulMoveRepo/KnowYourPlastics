Plastic makes up about 20% of landfill garbage, and less than 10% of them are recycled each year. Plastics are non-biodegradable; when degraded through chemical means or burning, they release toxic and carcinogenic substances, posing substantial threats to the environment. To understand and keep track of the plastic we use daily, we trained a deep learning model (transfer learning with ResNet 50) on over 10,000 images of 43 types of common plastic products. Through taking a photo or directly updating a photo from the album, the user will learn the type of plastic the product belong to, the properties and carbon footprint of the product and its potential damage to the environment.

The backend of the app is hosted on Heroku container, and mobile app front end is written by react native.
